Genetic Algorithms & Evolutionary Strategies implementations : School project in python (OOP)

PEP 8 conformance

## Objective

The objective of the project was to propose several GA & ES implementations.

Please note that I've chosen to do that Object python in order to learn the language and the GA & ES concepts: **first time I used this language** (some features may look a bit ugly)
